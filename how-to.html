		<div class="par">
			This site allows you to open any additional data that you&rsquo;d like
			to explore that isn&rsquo;t already in the dataset. These files will 
			not be saved or uploaded to a server anywhere. To prevent data loss due 
			to differences in data types and handling across software and languages,
			I suggest saving all of you data (at the very least the 
			geographic identifiers) that you intend to use as UTF-8 
			encoded character stings before attempting to load it. 
		</div>
		<div class="par">
			Variables should not be stored as <span class="mono">null</span> 
			unless you expect them to be treated as zeros or they are stored as a 
			character sting and you expect them to treated as missing values. 
			Variables in this form have not been rigorously tested; you may 
			risk data loss and failed or incorrect merges.
		</div>
		<div class="par">
			If any of your variables have the same name as a variable in the EO 
			dataset, the EO data will be overwritten.
