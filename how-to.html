		<h1>How to use this site:</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		This site was developed and tested using Chromium Browser (Google 
		Chrome). If something looks or acts a bit off, it might be because 
		your bowser.
		<h2>Navigation:</h2>
		<div class="par">
			Each of the options menus can be closed and opened 
			by clicking on the bars on the edges 
			of the window like the one below.
		</div>
		<div class="bar"></div> 
		<h3>Zoom:</h3>
		<div class="par">
			Click to zoom and center on a geography. To get a closer look, click on
			a smaller geography; the map scales proptionally to the area of the 
			geography.
			You can recenter the map
			by clicking the same geography twice or by clicking on the 
			background of the map.
		</div>
		<h2>Using your onwn data:</h2>
		<div class="par">
			This site allows you to open any additional data that you&rsquo;d like
			to explore that isn&rsquo;t already in the dataset. These files will 
			not be saved or uploaded to a severe anywhere. To prevent data loss due 
			to differences in data types and handling accross software and languages,
			I suggest saving all of you data (at the very least the 
			geographic identifiers) that you intend to use as UTF-8 
			encoded character stings before attempting to load it. 
		</div>
		<div class="par">
			Varibles should not be stored as <span class="mono">null</span> 
			unless you expect them to be treated as zeros or they are stored as a 
			character sting and you expecte them to treated as missing values. 
			Variables in this form have not been rigously tested; you may 
			risk data loss and failed or incorrect merges.
		</div>
		<div class="par">
			If any of your variables have the same name as a variable in the EoO 
			dataset, the EoO data will be overwritten.
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<div class="par">
			Click the top navigation bar at the top of the page, above the map&mdash;a
			dropdow box will open.	
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
			<div class="par">
			Click <div class="bttn">Choose a <span class="mono">.csv</span></div>. 
			Your machine will open a dialog box and allow you choose a file 
			that will open in your machine&rsquo;s memory. 
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
			<div class="par">
			Once the file is succesfully openend, the rest of the menu will be become
			active. Click on the selector at the top of the third column and choose 
			the varible in your dataset that uniquly matches the geographic 
			identifier in the Equality of Opportunity dataset. It must be a 
			contatenation of the 2000 two-digit state FIPS and three-digit 
			county FIPS codes with leading zeros. 
			</div>
			<div class="par">
				If you are loading data with missing geographic identifies, they 
				should be stored as <span class="mono">NA</span> or <span class="mono">NaN</span>.
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="par">
					Upon completion, you should see some information about the sucess 
					rate of the merge.	
				</div>	
				<div class="par">
					There are two  ways for your merge to partially
					or completely fail: your data contains codes not found in Equality 
					of Opportunity data or vice versa.	
				</div>
				<div class="par">
					If your merge partially (or completely) failed, you can download a 
					<span class="mono">.json</span> file that the unmatched observations
					from your data set and the identifiers of the unmatched observations
					from the EoO data. A generalized exmaple of the file structure is 
					below:
					<div class="code">
						{unmatched_cli: 
							<br/>[{var1: observation1, var2: observation1, ... varK: observation1},
							<br/>{var1: observation2, var2: observation2, ... varK: observation2},
							<br/>... , 
							<br/>{var1: observationN, var2: observationN, ... varK: observationN}],
						<br/>unmatced_serv: 
							<br/>[{GEOID: observation1, ST: observation1, COUNTY: observation1},
							<br/>... , 
							<br/>{GEOID: observationN, ST: observationN, COUNTY: observationN}]
						<br/>}
					</div> 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="par">
					If your merge was patially (or completely) successful, you&rsquo;ll be able to
					export the data as a <span class="mono">.csv</span><br/>
					(At the very least, this site can be used as interactive tool to 
					merge data.)
				</div>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="par">
			You will now be able to use any of the mapping, plotting, regression 
			table, and monotonic transformation features on your data.	
		</div>
		<div class="par">
			Multipule datasets can be opend and merged as long as they don&rsquo;t 
			have the same varible names of the EoO data or your previously 
			loaded files.
