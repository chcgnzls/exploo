		<h2 id="data">Using your own data:</h2>
		<div class="par">
			This site allows you upload and merge data to the EO dataset. 
			These files will not be saved. To prevent data loss, I suggest 
			saving all of you data 
			(at the very least the geographic identifiers) that you intend to use 
			as UTF-8 encoded character strings before attempting to load it.

			Variable names in you dataset and the EO dataset can&rsquo;t be the same,

			<h4>Note on <span class="mono">null</span> types:</h4>
			Variables should not be stored as <span class="mono">null</span> 
			unless you expect them to be treated as zeros or if they are stored as a 
			character string and you expect them to treated as missing values. 
			Variables in this form have not been rigorously tested; you may 
			risk data loss and failed or incorrect merges.
